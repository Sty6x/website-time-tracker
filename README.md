# website-time-tracker

Building chrome extension that tracks how long you visited and how many times you visited a website.

#### How it works

Everytime a user visits a website, users are able to track the current website that they are currently in.  
this will grab the initial visited time of a user and everytime a user leaves or disconnects a tab or website, the extension will then calculate the **total time spent** and **daily time spent**, contrary to the **total time spent**, the **daily time spent** will reset daily (obviously).

#### Why did i make this

Was curious on how chrome extension works and how to make one, but the reason why i made this particular project, where it would track the visited sites, is so that I could be more mindful on how many times and how long i've visited any social media sites, which is getting pretty annoying.

#### What i've learned

Im very well aware of how bad my code looks like, i've practiced how to make my code more cleaner and more modular, and also this project helped me boost up my systematic thinking, where instead of jamming every code and hope that it works and then not knowing how it works, instead it made me sit down, talk to myself, think of the problem and understand these problems, write down these problems and how i could break them down in a molecular level, where it would become more easier to solve and then think of a solution and applied these solutions to the problem.
